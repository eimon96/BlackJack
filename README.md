# BlackJack

IntelliJ IDEA - JDK 14.0.1

A simplified version of BlackJack in Java.
By "simplified" I mean you don't gamble (there is no bet, neither insurance, double, surrender which go along with bet).
However I'm going to add "split" option in the future.

I'm going to improve it over time.
Enjoy xD
