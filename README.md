# BlackJack

IntelliJ IDEA - JDK 14.0.1

A simplified version of BlackJack in Java.
By "simplified" I mean you don't gamble (there is no bet, neither insurance, double, surrender which go along with bet).
Theoretically you play with infinite decks.

All other rules are the same. Dealer hits S17 and stands H17.

I'm going to improve it over time (also add "split" option). 
Enjoy xD
